					<description><![CDATA[Cleveland Diagnostics, Inc., a clinical-stage company focused on developing next-generation diagnostic tests for the detection of cancers, today announced the online publication of results from a multicenter validation study of IsoPSA™, a novel structure-based prostate cancer assay, in Journal of Urology. The study validated the findings from a preliminary study published earlier in European Urology, demonstrating that the non-invasive, blood-based IsoPSA assay has superior diagnostic accuracy over the current gold standard, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), in detecting high-grade prostate cancer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As Centerline Biomedical, Inc. prepares to meet with investors, strategic partners and companies in the healthcare industry during the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, it successfully completed a fifth preclinical study at Cleveland Clinic facilities evaluating its surgical navigation system, IOPS, the Intra-Operative Positioning System. This study was the most noteworthy Centerline study to date, demonstrating ability to track sensorized IOPS instruments precisely and efficiently, with enhanced 3-D visualization, without frequent exposure to cancer-causing ionizing radiation associated with current standard of care. Endovascular surgeries i.e. those which repair arteries using stents rely on X-ray fluoroscopy, which provides limited two-dimensional visualization, leading to long procedure times while exposing surgeons and patients to damaging radiation. IOPS, originally developed at Cleveland Clinic, uses a 3-D model of a patient's vascular system to track instruments precisely without ionizing radiation, with the goal of reducing procedure times, complication rates, and overall costs. The mathematical algorithms used to generate the 3-D model are currently being used to revolutionize minimally invasive surgery, with future applications in surgical training and clinical decision support.]]></description>
